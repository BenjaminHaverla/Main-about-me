# Lee Aremberg (American actor) – beautiful conversation
When my short film "THE LAST LETTER" was nominated in RED Movie Awards film festival. I had opportunity to talk with famous actor Lee Aremberg who is best known for his role as Pintel, one of Captain Barbossa's crew, in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. He also had a recurring role as the dwarf Grumpy in the television series Once Upon a Time.
