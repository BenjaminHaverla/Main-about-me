# Lee Arenberg (American actor) – beautiful conversation
When my short film ["THE LAST LETTER"](https://filmfreeway.com/projects/2082837) was nominated in the RED Movie Awards film festival, I had the opportunity to talk with the famous actor [Lee Arenberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0034305/). He is best known for his role as Pintel, one of Captain Barbossa's crew, in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. He also had a recurring role as the dwarf Grumpy in the television series [Once Upon a Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843230/).
